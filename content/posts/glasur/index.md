The landing page was back up just minutes before Dagfrid stepped on stage and displayed it on the big screen.

After the presentation Dagfrid was joined by Steinar Hoen, Stevnedirektør Bislett Games, idrettspresident Tom Tvedt, Bård Vegar Solhjell leder i WWF and Rina Mariann Hansen, Byråd for kultur, idrett og frivillighet for a panel discussion.

The leader of the debate was Linnéa Svensson from Greener Events. In the audience was Tony Isaksen Generalsekretær of Norway Cup, Terje Jørgensen Særforbundenes Fellesorganisasjon and Sissel Karlsen in Sparebankstiftelsen DNB. Sparebankstiftelsen DNB has paid for Grønn Idrett and the inspiration for the drawings is the beautiful book
