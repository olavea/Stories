“200+ years ago on
the Scandinavian sun coast…”

PIRATE
WARS

It is a period of piratical war.
Pirate ships, striking
from a hidden base, have won
their first victory against
the Tyrannical British Empire.

During the battle, Pirate
spies managed to steal secret
technical drawings of the Empire's
ultimate weapon, the DICTATOR,
a ship with a new set of
cannons with long enough range to
bombard and destroy the
island towns of the Pirat Republic.

Pursued by the Empire's
sinister agents, Pirate Princess
Frøydis races home aboard her
sleek ship, custodian of the
stolen plans that can save
her pirate people and restore
freedom to the Scandinavia coastline…

On the same coastline, but back
in our time Lilly (11) is sooo
boooored on the summer cabin
on a workation with her mother,
grandmother and a gigantic cat.
Lilly (11) wants to work on a
real programming project.

Once the crawl ends, we pan past a couple islands to reveal the cacophonous sea battle erupts around us and a small pirate ship glides past pursued by a much larger ship-of-the-line that seems to go on forever.

The pirate ship glides past a bunch of other pirate ships, which are sunk.

BatCat and boy on board the pirate ship, they are helpless bystanders to a musket battle between the Rebel pirates and the Imperial boarding party.

as a chaotic musket battle rages on deck of the pirate ship, BatCat and Boy pass between a spider web of criss-crossing musket balls and are miraculously unharmed.

Once the pirates are dead, the leader of the Imperial Forces makes his entrance, a towering red-clad figure,

a feminine hand programming BatCat,

Jump'n wave

Lilly sees the splash and the waving in her old brass spyglass.

She sees the little boat floating along un-stopped.

She sees the heads of BatCat and Boy come up breathing hard.

Se runs down the stairs, I will save the cat and boy!

 –Hey! Psst! Don't go over that bridge...
 –What! Why?
 –Well... There are kidnappers across that bridge and...
 –Kidnappers! The Little People live across that bridge, you saying
 they stole a kid?!
 –Well catnappers then...
 –Ah! You are the boy with the cat, the Little People stole your cat?
 The Little People DO steal and lie, but a cat... That is NOT ok! I will teach them a lesson! Right now. Come with me!
 –Wait...

 Lilly strides onto the bridge shouting at the top of her voice

 –Rooooobin! Come out here right this minute or I will spank your bare ass blue!

From the middle of the bridge Lilly sees a large wood
building that was hidden behind the thorn bushes.
It is many stories high. High up, inside a net hangs the yellow cat.

The other end of the bridge is blocked by a group of little green figures.
 –Oi! Boy. Step over here!
 –What is it?
 –I will charge in amongst them and toss you one of them. It is essential
 that you hold the little creature on the outside of the fence of the
 bridge. They HATE seawater, if they fear you will drop him they will
 not shoot you with their little bows.
 –Ok.
 Lilly strides towards the little ones.
 –Rooooobin! You little twat! Where are you?!
 –He is busy miss Raae.
 –Not to busy to talk to me.
 –Hey! Let go my arm. Woooaaaaaaaah!
 –Grab him and hold him like I said!
 Lilly holds another little one over the fence.
 –Robin! I will drop this insect into the sea if you don't show your ugly face right now!
 –What is all the ruckus!?
 All the little ones turn to look at the newcomer. And Lilly pushes right
 through them while they are distracted.
 She runs right towards Robin in the doorway.
 Whispering into the ear of the one she is holding
 –On the count of three you fly straight up and I will not throw you into the sea.
 –Ok.
Lilly takes a running jump up on the fake wheel of the house.
 –1-2-3!
 Lilly jumps up grabs the net with the cat.
 –Fly you bug! Fly for your life.
 She climbs the net up to the rope holding it.
 –Ok, cat you better know how to land.
 –Yepp!
 Lilly draws a large knife and haks the rope right off. Cat and girl falls.

 –Hang on! Shouts the cat
 –Sure.
The yellow cat lands softly with Lilly on her back
–Robin! I will have my boy over there drop that insect friend of yours into the sea if you don't let us go on our way.
–You will pay for this!
–Sure I will, NOT! See yoi around Robin.
–Whatever.

They go up the 89 steps to the cabin and Lilly hides cat&boy in the wood shed.
–Surely you must be joking this is going to be darn cold when the sun goes down.
–I might be able to smuggle you insde when everybody is asleep, but I might also not, they usually stays up late. Here is  atowel I'll dry you off Cat. You don't mind if i call you Cat do you?
–Not in the least. Ah, yeah scratch my ears...
–Hey what is this west, it has buttons.
–Don't touch my west!

–Help me Obi-Wes BosObi you are our only hope.
–Who is she?  She’s cool…
–It’s a private message for Obi-Wes BosObi

–Hey mom, who is Obi-Wes BosObi?
–Maybe it is Ben BosObi. That witch is just a crazy little orphan girl. A dude named Ben.
–I want to go to that code boot camp in New York City this winter.
–No way you are to young.
–Ok, then I want a real code project with a real client.
–I'll think about it

feeling trapped watching the sun set over the ocean.
Goes into wood shed
–What's up boy?
–The cat left.
–What? Where did it go?
–To this Obi-Wes BosObi, never heard of her.
–I know where she lives...
–But?
–But it is dangerous to go there after dark.
–We're going anway.
–Yes we are.

It is NOT an ordinary Monday morning for the NOT–a–morning–person and full stack developer (Siv.Ing) Benedicte.

Only good thing is that she is still in bed. The bad things: a bad cough, bad headache, fever, no coffee and daughter not yet delivered in kindergarten.

"Why no coffee in bed?" You might ask. Because Benedicte’s partner in crime, Ola, is at a «better bærekraft in sports» breakfast release party at Bislett Stadion.

He has built a lightweight landing page for Grønn Idrett. In an hour Ex-Secretary General of the Norwegian Snowboard Federation, Dagfrid Forberg, will go on stage and present the landing page to promote the «Best Bærekraft in Norwegian Sports 2018» competition.

But the landing page is not working!

Benedicte luckily checks her phone and springs into action.

–Lillian! Let’s go hunt some bugs! Benedicte shouts to Lillian (3).

–Jippi! is the answer.

–Go get our virtual reality helmets!

–Yesss!
