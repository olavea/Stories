It is NOT an ordinary Monday morning for the NOT–a–morning–person and full stack developer (Siv.Ing) Benedicte.

Only good thing is that she is still in bed. The bad things: a bad cough, bad headache, fever, no coffee and daughter not yet delivered in kindergarten.

"Why no coffee in bed?" You might ask. Because Benedicte’s partner in crime, Ola, is at a «better bærekraft in sports» breakfast release party at Bislett Stadion.

He has built a lightweight landing page for Grønn Idrett. In an hour Ex-Secretary General of the Norwegian Snowboard Federation, Dagfrid Forberg, will go on stage and present the landing page to promote the «Best Bærekraft in Norwegian Sports 2018» competition.

But the landing page is not working!

Benedicte luckily checks her phone and springs into action.

–Lillian! Let’s go hunt some bugs! Benedicte shouts to Lillian (3).

–Jippi! is the answer.

–Go get our virtual reality helmets!

–Yesss!
